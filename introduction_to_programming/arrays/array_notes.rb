# An array is an ordered list of elements that can be of any type. 
# you define an array by placing the list of elements between brackets [].
# index begins at 0
# .first finds the first element
# .last finds the last element
# pop to take the last element off permanently (mutates the caller)
# push (<<) to add that element back onto the array (mutates the caller and modifies the original array)
# unshift adds a specified element to the front. 

# The map/collect method iterates over an array applying a block to each element of the array and returns a new array with those results.  

# delete_at()  removes an element from a specific index
# delete is useful if you know the element that you want to destroy but not the index of where its at. 

# uniq iterates through the array and deletes the multiples and returns a new array

# ! bang method usually indicates that it will mutate the caller permanently.  

# include? checks to see if the argument is given in the included array.  boolean value because of the ?

# flatten take an array that contains nested arrays and creates one-dimensional array
#   ex: a = [1, 2, [3, 4, 5], [6, 7]]
#       a.flatten 
#       [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

# each_index variable represents the index rather than the value of the index

# each_with_index is given 2 parameters so that it  can show the value and index.

# sort orders the array

# product combine two arrays an array that is a combination of all elements from all arrays.  

# each vs map
# each for iteration
# map for transformation
